# Wildcards Directory

Place your custom text files (`.txt`) in this folder to use them as wildcards in Spectra Tools.

## How it works
If you create a file named `colors.txt`, you can use `__colors__` in your prompt. Spectra Tools will randomly pick a line from that file.

### Example: colors.txt
```text
Red
Blue
Neon Green
Dark Matter
```
